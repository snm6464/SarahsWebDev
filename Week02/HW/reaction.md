## Wireframing Reflection
After reading this article on wireframing, I understand even more why it is important to do this step in web development. Not only do I know it is costly to get straight to development, but I also now know how important it is for many other reasons and uses, and I also know better ways of going about it. From reading this article I learned that wireframing does not need to be fancy and can be done in many different ways (for example, a whiteboard). Doing an initial mockup allows customers to give you feedback on the basics, especially when you are unsure of what that kind of customer wants. Just knowing where to start on a basic level is so important and means that the development process is going to be that much easier.
